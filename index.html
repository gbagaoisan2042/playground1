                        <h2>The opposite of creating, is reacting...</h2>
                        <p>Most everyone has had an idea of what they wanted their life to look like. More often than not, we go on living life and see that what we have created does not look and feel like what we had originally intended. The reason we get off the path of what we had envisioned at an early age is because at some point we started <strong>reacting to life rather than creating the lives we want</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <p>The moment we stop reacting and start creating is the moment we stop living for Love and start living from Love.</p>

                        <p>I began making this switch (still am) during my Sophomore year of college. Until then I was someone who had it decently together (had good friends, never got into serious trouble), yet was so alone inside. I don't think I was even aware that I was because I simply did not know any better. Aside from a few pockets of really feeling that I was loved towards my senior year, I felt mostly empty inside.
                        </p>

                        <p>There really is no lonelier feeling than having tons of friends and a good family to surround you, yet feeling so empty and unknown. I remember feeling such pressure to be amazing or impressive in some way. I wasn't smart enough at school or athletic enough to do this through academics or sports, so I decided to become a “superstar Christian”. This is what would make my parents proud and would win the approval that I desperately wanted from everyone around me.</p>

                        <p>It wasn't until my sophomore year of college that someone gave me an experience of love that I had been craving at the deepest part of my soul and I began to turn the corner and start living my life from being Loved. I realized I had become a fraud in my pursuit of being a “Christian Leader”. I was trying to be something externally before I became it internally. I began to see that, until this moment, my life had been reactionary to not feeling loved and I was creating something I wanted no part of.</p>

                        <p>Had I not had this experience and not “woken up” to the path that I was on, I am certain that I would have settled with being some sort of leader within the “church” probably still addicted to porn, or maybe had an affair. I would never have learned how to connect to my (now) amazing wife and we probably would have wound up being more of roommates than soul mates.</p>
